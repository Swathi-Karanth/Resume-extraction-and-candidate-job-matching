Living in a rural community, residents
were dependent on our volunteer fire department for all medical and fire emergencies until other paid departments could arrive. After watching my
grandmother pass away because no one in our family was capable of providing CPR, I realized I needed to step up and joined our local Volunteer
Fire Department. I completed EMT training at Miramar College, and then a 12-week National Fire Academy, where I was one of only 4 womento pass. Â It was truly the most physically challenging endeavor I've ever completed, but certainly one I am incredibly proud of! Â I served as a

Personal Information
I grew up on a farm in a small town of Superior, Pennsylvania. My early influences were all centered on food. My grandparents grew and sold
their own vegetables and meats. 
Dennis Turkey Farm 
was known for its customer satisfaction and â€˜clean farm' practices. I learned about
environmental stewardship from grandparents that farmed holistically. I fondly remember working with Grandpa Dennis, plucking turkey feathers
and processing chickens to fill the latest orders.Inside the farmhouse, I sat wide eyed watching my grandmother make what seemed like magic in
her big wooden bowl filling the orders for our family restaurant called 
Glisans
 .I credit my grandmother for instilling within me the passion for
savory and baking and using all of the chef senses! I have worked practically all of my life in some form within the hospitality world. I am very
creative, positive, warm, personable with strong attention to detail and management"

Summary
My name is Evan Elias, I have recently made the important decision about my career. Computers are going fast and the world of computers is
expanding to all the corners of the earth. I want to be part of this ever-evolving staple of humanity. I also want to be able to cook and provide for
people who cannot do it themselves and be a contributor to technology in my course of life. I have taken many classes on programming and taught
myself about the IT aspect of computers. I am very strong in math and I like to solve problems. I have taken many cooking classes and have
worked in every position in a kitchen."

establishment, I was brought on to open gastro pubs such as Sixty Park next door to the PAC Center and the Tap House Grill. I opened these
establishments as upscale casual and rustic comfort food with banquet and catering on site to excellent reviews and a steady following. I am also
heavily involved as a lead chef consultant for creating successful menus and kitchen designs to open such restaurants as Halcyon and Montclair
Station in Montclair NJ and Bistro Seven Three in Bernardsville. I stand by my food with simple and colorful plate designs with bold flavors and
my ability to train and inspire my staff with my progressive and lead by example philosophy. With me you will get a loyal hardworking chef with a
love of our industry. I take my craft seriously bringing no ego just passion, pride and ambition number. I am available to interview at your earliest
convenience if you believe I meet your standards.

unrelated but both deal with people and expressing the human condition. While one does it through studying actions and artifacts to better
understand different cultures and time periods, the other deals with feelings and views shown through art. They are different but together they are a
good combination for a more rounded point of view. Â

and I taught three different lessons and led several small groups in discussions about various math articles. One lesson we taught was reviewing
order of operations. Since the students were newly familiar with the information we wanted them to get some practice working on various
problems using multiple operations. We played â€œI have, who has?â€​ As each student read their equation to the class I would write it on the
board so that they could visualize it and write it down. Students would call out the answer when it was their card and then we solved the problem
on the board as a class before we moved on to the next card. The students really enjoyed this because it was something that we did all together
and they saw it as more of a game and thought it was fun."

This retail store was a newest branch of an old, well established, family owned chain of stores from the east side of the state.Â  The family had
recently hired a new, young general manager.Â  He was responsible, apparently, for some poor management decisions, resulting in the parent
company going into bankruptcy and all stores being shut down.Â

Converted 7500 square feet of commercial space into 24 individual offices of varying sizes, several cubicle spaces, large and small conference
rooms, reception area, secretarial work area and lounge.
Individual offices were rented to independent business persons by the month, cubicles by the day or hour.Â  All phone calls answered by staff and
messages taken.Â  Secretarial services available to tenants, as well as outside clients, for an hourly fee.Â  Conference rooms available on a daily
or hourly basis.Â  Other business services included hosting meetings or conferences and publishing marketing materials for tenants and outside
clients.
Building was sold in 1993 and new owner had other plans for the space and refused to renew the lease.Â  I had moved the business once and
paid for build-out of this space.Â  I couldn't afford to move again; decided to close business instead.

Consulted with clients to determine architectural preference to meet overall design goals.
Originated and developed creative design concepts.
Assisted clients with budget considerations regarding products and materials.
Successfully resolved complex technical design issues.Interfaced with architects, contractors, sub-contractors, consultants, fabricators, and regulatory agencies.
Specified proper products and materials for each project.
Prepared construction documents and details to implement design concepts.
Established at the time of graduation from design school, I began my independent career, on a full-time basis.Â  When business was slow (due to
recession, etc.) I accepted employment with well established firms.Â  I have continued to serve many repeat clients and referrals over the years.
Transitional Vocation
In 1981, before the advent and common use of CAD programs, I had a serious injury to my right (drawing) hand.Â  I was owner of income
properties and had been managing income propertiesfor other individual owners.Â  Since I was not going to be able to use my hand again for
drawing for some time, I took a position as a manager of a 160 unit apartment project that was only 50% occupied.Â  Within six months, all units
were rehabbed, rentable and occupied, and 95-100% occupancy was maintained while I was manager.Â  
In 1983, I was offered a position with another firm as Project Manager during construction and Start-Up Manager of a 360 unit apartment
complex.Â  Being involved at the inception, I was able to revise apartment floor plans to made accommodation for the most common objections I
heard while marketing existing floor plans.Â  My revised plans were very successful and apartments were filled as fast as they were built, with a
long waiting list.Â  Approximately 1/3 of the tenants from the first project I had managed, moved to the new complex, which was extremely
gratifying.Â  I continued in this position to the end of construction.Â  During that time, I attended property management courses and earned a
Residential Property Management Certificate.
My hand was rehabilitated by this time and I decided it was time to return to my real passion, interior design. Â","1970

During my Preceptorship Project (needs
assessment and literary review phase) I conducted focus groups regarding underutilization of health education services in the community served by
the Delta Area Health Education Center in Phillips County Arkansas. The overarching goal was to utilize focus group data findings to help the
Delta AHEC develop a plan of action for quality/effective health education services delivery. 
The project developed into my Capstone Project in
which I developed a Services Promotion Plan to help address, and evaluate the barriers in health education services provided by the Delta AHEC,
and also help enhance community based participation by minority residents.

Leaders learn how to use three Change Accelerators to turn resistance into commitment and inspire team members to take ownership of

Communication Dynamics 
Emotional Intelligence, Houston Partners International, Ports America So Cal Regional Office, 2012
Communication for Leadership Success, DDI, Ports America So Cal Regional Office, 2013.
This course introduces leaders to the essential interaction skills that are critical to leadership success.
These Interaction Essentials are the core behaviors that leaders need to be effective in the many situations they handle on a daily basis, such
as coaching, delegating, and driving change.Leaders learn how to meet the personal and practical needs of their team members and how to communicate to spark action in others to
achieve business results.
The goal is that leaders learn how to provide positive feedback that recognizes and motivates individuals and teams as well as
developmental feedback that helps others get back on track.

Provides awareness to the physical effects of drugs and alcohol and how to witness the symptoms.
Helps front line managers to reasonably suspect an employee of being under the influence.
Volunteer Orange County Makos, Defensive Coordinator, Fullerton, CA The opportunity to coach opened up my eyes to the benefits of
encouragement and leading thru adversity.
The team was wrought with internal struggles because of the lack of trust in team ownership.
As the Defensive Coordinator, I was challenged to convince the defensive players to trust the work ethic of the offensive players and to
verbally encourage their play.
In 2001, we had a head coach and ownership change and with 95% of the previous team returning, we reshaped expectations and built
confidence thru competition.
We finished the year as CFL Champions.
AYSO, Coach, Long Beach, CA Coaching young children has helped me to simplify instructions, gauge motivation in each child and tailor
my approach to build their confidence.
These key points, I learned coaching young and older athletes crosses over to employees.
People need consistent and helpful direction to improve their performance and ability to hone their craft.
Athletes and employees look to their coach or boss for leadership and motivation to help them reach their full potential.
